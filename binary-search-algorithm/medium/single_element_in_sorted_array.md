# Single Element in a Sorted Array

# Simple Solution:

Use maps - store the counts of each, then traverse the map to get the single element
This has O(n) - not the best solution , space = O(n)

With linear search also - like traverse - if next ele is not same to curr then return - O(n)

# The better solution
